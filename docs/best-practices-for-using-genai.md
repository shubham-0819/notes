title: Best practices for building apps using GenAI APIs.

### 1. Use the Right Model for the Right Task

- Select Lightweight Models for Simple Tasks: Use smaller, cheaper models like GPT-3.5 Turbo for simpler tasks (e.g., text completion or sentiment analysis), reserving more powerful models (like GPT-4) for complex tasks (e.g., multi-step reasoning).
- Optimize Based on Use Cases: Categorize tasks based on complexity and frequency, and assign different models accordingly. For example, Codex for code generation and DALL-E for image generation, using lower-cost models where possible.

### 2. Implement Caching and Reuse Responses

- Cache Repeated Queries: If your app is making similar queries frequently, cache responses and reuse them. This avoids redundant API calls and reduces costs.
- Store Results Locally: For static or repetitive data generation, store responses in a local database instead of calling the API repeatedly.

### 3. Minimize Token Usage

- Shorter Prompts: LLMs like GPT models charge based on tokens used (both input and output). Keep prompts concise and to the point to reduce token consumption.
- Limit Output Length: Use the `max_tokens` parameter to control the length of responses and avoid unnecessarily long completions.

### 4. Use Prompt Engineering Techniques

- Prompt Optimization: Carefully craft prompts to get the most precise and accurate responses in fewer tokens. By reducing ambiguity, you can avoid making follow-up calls or re-tries.
- Chain-of-Thought: For complex tasks, break down the queries into smaller, simpler steps that can be handled by cheaper models or processes, and avoid unnecessarily complex operations.

### 5. Fine-tune for Specialized Tasks

- Fine-tuning: If your application relies on repeated, domain-specific queries, consider fine-tuning a smaller model (if available) on your specific dataset. This allows the model to become more efficient at your tasks, reducing the need for complex prompts.
- Preprocess and Post-process Locally: Offload pre-processing (e.g., data cleaning, summarizing) and post-processing tasks (e.g., formatting) to local servers to reduce API calls.

### 6. Rate Limiting and Throttling

- Rate Limits: Set rate limits on API calls to avoid accidental overuse, especially when scaling up. Many APIs charge based on the number of requests, so throttling can help control costs.
- Batch Requests: Where possible, batch requests or combine multiple tasks into a single API call (if the API supports it).

### 7. Use Lower-Priced Deployment Options

- Model Pricing Tiers: Leverage different pricing tiers, and use free trial periods or credits offered by the API providers for initial development and testing.
- Regional API Endpoints: If the provider offers regional pricing differences, you can select endpoints that may offer lower costs depending on geographic regions.

### 8. Monitor and Track Usage

- Usage Metrics: Implement logging and tracking of all API usage so you can identify high-cost areas, optimize them, and avoid unnecessary calls.
- Budget Alerts: Set up budget alerts or limits via the API provider’s platform to ensure you don’t exceed your desired spending.

### 9. Hybrid Approaches

- On-Premise or Open Source: For tasks that require constant, high-volume processing, consider using open-source models like GPT-Neo or running LLMs locally (though they may be less powerful). This can supplement your API-based usage and reduce costs.
- Manual Overrides: Provide human overrides for extremely complex or high-cost processes to avoid relying on the LLM for all decision-making.

### 10. Periodic Audits and Optimization

- Review API Usage Regularly: Periodically audit your API calls and results. Review patterns to identify where your app might be over-relying on the AI and optimize accordingly.
- A/B Testing for Cost Efficiency: Test different versions of your prompt structures, models, and batching strategies to find the most cost-efficient solution without sacrificing performance.

### Example Strategy:

- Chat and Text Generation: Use GPT-3.5, GPT-4o-mini, Turbo for conversational interfaces or text generation where high precision is not critical. Implement caching for repeated answers.
- Summarization and Question Answering: Use a lower-token limit and carefully engineered prompts to get concise summaries. If questions are repetitive, cache them.
- Complex Reasoning or High-Stakes Output: Delegate to GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini or fine-tuned models only when necessary.
